Dear $name,

We are researchers in the field of software engineering at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. 
Our objective is to better understand your views regarding the utilization of tools for facilitating software maintenance in practice.

Considering your contributions to the $owner $project project, your anonymous input would be invaluable.
To help us, you can answer one or more of five short surveys (approx. 5-8 minutes each). Each survey addresses a specific scenario illustrating a tool usage:

	- A bot that labels issues based on issue text: https://forms.gle/oYTyxhbhirTaMgY3A

	- A dashboard that presents the amount of code smells and technical debt: https://forms.gle/Jc6fsAeh2VsAHLe29

	- A ItelliJ IDEA plugin that suggests refactoring actions: https://forms.gle/Tz3XcaCQ9jxiCg297

	- A Travis CI job that notifies stakeholders considering quality metrics: https://forms.gle/MghJLApVPeMYLyYC7

	- A bot that facilitates code review in Github pull requests: https://forms.gle/bZkSBcjbXfmfavQ48

Among other goals, we aim to build and help others build support tools that are driven by the added value for the developer.

Thank you for considering our invitation, and we look forward to your valuable insights. 

If you have any questions, please contact us. Please also contact us if you do not want to receive such emails in the future.


Sincerely,

--
